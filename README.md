# SchemeLab
I plan to use this repository for keeping track of my experiments
in Scheme.
I will aim to write my code in a very functional way, using very few,
if any, procedural parts of the language.
This means, many of my methods will make heavy use of tail-recursion.
Macros will only be used to refactor repetitive code.
